# First video project

This is my first attempt at making a video demo. This was a great learning experience
for me.

This project was aimed to help someone who is looking for more resources on how to
setup a front end that can communicate with a backend.
With this video, we create a UI that lets a restaurant create an item and create menus.
This assignment was inspired by a studio in the Launch Code, unit-2, Java course.

For the backend, this demo goes over a basic use of controllers, models, and
repositories. We also create some controller methods. 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'GET'
are the request that we made.

For the frontend, we set up some forms and set up some components to use, organize
and display the information the user is creating.

I do my best to observe OOP patterns, but I am still relativly new. At the time of
posting this repository, I graduated from LaunchCode 3 months ago. If you view
this video, or browse this git repo, I am open to constructive feedback.

The techstack used with this project is...
FrontEnd:
Next.JS
TypeScript
Tailwind

BackEnd:
SpringBoot
Java

Database:
MySql
